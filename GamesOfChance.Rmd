# Define the variables

Here we establish the global variables for the project, and load any packages needed

```{python init_vars}
#--INITIALISE--#
import random
denomination = "chips"
wallet = 100
```

# Define utility functions

Here we establish functions that will be used only by other functions.

The print_result function outputs the result of any game function, adding information about the player's remaining balance. Although it's only a single line of code, I chose to make it a utility function so I can change the layout of the output display in one place.

```{python def_gen_func}
#--DEFINE UTILITY FUNCTIONS--#
def print_result(result):
    # Output result
    print(result + "\n\nYou have " + str(wallet) + " " + denomination + " left.")
```

# Define the games

## Coin Toss

The Coin Toss game takes a pot (the amount the player bets) as an integer and a call as either heads or tails. The game then calculates the result of the coin toss. If the player correctly guessed the result, they win, adding the value of the pot to their wallet. Otherwise they lose, subtracting the value of the pot from their wallet.

1. The two possible call values are asigned to a list called **outcomes** so that we can (using *list*.index) view the call as either a string or an integer
2. Assign a random int between 0 and 1 for the result of the **toss** (heads and tails respectively)
3. Find the string version of the **toss** result by using the **toss** result as the index for returning a value from the **outcomes** list
4. Convert the original **call** value to an integer by looking up the string value in the **outcomes** list and returning it's posision (with *list*.index)
5. Process the result of the game...
    1. Populate the **result** value based on comparing **toss** to **call**
    2. Adjust the **wallet** *global* variable by the pot accordingly
6. Pass the **result** of the game to the **print_result** function to display it

```{python def_coin_toss}
#--DEFINE GAME FUNCTIONS--#
# Coin Toss
def coin_toss(pot, call):
    # Define variables
    global wallet
    outcomes = ["heads", "tails"]
    toss = random.randint(0,1)
    toss_string = outcomes[toss]
    call = outcomes.index(call)
    
    # Find result
    if call == toss:
        result = toss_string + "\n\nYou guessed correctly!\n\nYou won " + str(pot) + " " + denomination + "!"
        wallet += pot
    else:
        result = toss_string + "\n\nYou guessed incorrectly.\n\nYou lost " + str(pot) + " " + denomination + "."
        wallet -= pot

    # Output result
    print_result(result)
```    

## Cho Han

The Cho Han game takes a pot (the amount the player bets) as an integer and a call as either even or odd. The game then picks two random numbers and adds them together, to get a number if that is either odd or even. If the player correctly guesses whether the number would be odd or even, they win, adding the value of the pot to their wallet. Otherwise they lose, subtracting the value of the pot from their wallet.

1. The two possible call values are asigned to a list called **outcomes** so that we can (using *list*.index) view the call as either a string or an integer
2. Assign a random int between 0 and 1 for the result of the **roll** (even and odd respectively)
3. Find the string version of the **roll** result by using the **roll** result as the index for returning a value from the **outcomes** list
4. Convert the original **call** value to an integer by looking up the string value in the **outcomes** list and returning it's posision (with *list*.index)
5. Process the result of the game...
    1. Populate the **result** value based on comparing **roll** to **call**
    2. Adjust the **wallet** *global* variable by the pot accordingly
6. Pass the **result** of the game to the **print_result** function to display it

```{python def_cho-han}
# Cho-Han
def cho_han(pot, call):
    # Define variables
    global wallet
    outcomes = ["even", "odd"]
    roll = random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6)
    roll_type = roll % 2
    roll_string = outcomes[roll_type]
    call = outcomes.index(call)

    # Find result
    if call == roll_type:
        result = str(roll) + "... " + roll_string + "\n\nYou guessed correctly!\n\nYou won " + str(pot) + " " + denomination + "!"
        wallet += pot
    else:
        result = str(roll) + "... " + roll_string + "\n\nYou guessed incorrectly.\n\nYou lost " + str(pot) + " " + denomination + "."
        wallet -= pot
    
    # Output result
    print_result(result)
```

## Card Draw

The Card Draw game takes only the pot (the amount the player bets.) The game calculates two numbers, one for the player and another for the game. If the player's number is higher they win, adding the value of the pot to their wallet. If it is the same as the game's number they draw and neither win or lose any money. If the player's number is lower than the game's number the player loses, subtracting the value of the pot from their wallet.

1. Assign random numbers to the **player_card** and **game_card** variables
2. Prepare the first part of the **result text**, as this will be the same regardless
5. Process the result of the game...
    1. Populate the **result** value based on comparing **player_card** to **game_card**
    2. Adjust the **wallet** *global* variable by the pot accordingly
6. Pass the **result** of the game to the **print_result** function to display it

```{python}
# Card Draw
def card_draw(pot):
  # Define variables
  global wallet
  player_card = random.randint(1,10)
  game_card = random.randint(1,10)
  result = "You drew " + str(player_card) + " and I drew " + str(game_card) + ".\n\n"
  
  #Find result
  if player_card > game_card:
    result += "You win!\n\nYou won " + str(pot) + denomination + "."
    wallet += pot
  elif player_card < game_card:
    result += "I won!\n\nYou lost " + str(pot) + denomination + "."
    wallet -= pot
  else:
    result += "We drew.\n\nYou didn't win or lose."
    
  # Output result
  print_result(result)
```
